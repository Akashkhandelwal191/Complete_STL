Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standard “first-class” container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.

A.Sequence Containers: implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.

1.Vector
2.List
3.Deque
4.Arrays
5.forward_list


B.Container Adaptors:provide a different interface for sequential containers.

1.Queue
2.Priority_queue
3.Stack


C.Associative Containers

1.Set
2.MultiSet
3.Map
4.MultiMap


d.Unordered Associative Containers : implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched


1.Unordered_set
2.Unordered_map
3.Unordered_multimap
4.Unordered_multiset
