/*

if we want to find the largest element in an array or vector or list or in a sub-section. 
To serve this purpose, we have std::max_element in C++.

std::max_element is defined inside the header file and it returns an iterator pointing to the element with the largest value in the range [first, last).

std::max_element can be used in two ways. The comparisons can be performed either usingoperator < (first version), or using a pre-defined function (second version). 
If more than one element satisfies the condition of being the largest, the iterator returned points to the first of such elements.
