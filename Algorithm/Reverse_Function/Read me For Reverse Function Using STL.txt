reverse() is a predefined function in header file algorithm. It is defined as a template in the above mentioned header file. It reverses the order of the elements in the range [first, last) of any container. The time complexity is O(n). 
Note: The range used is [first, last), which contains all the elements between first and last, including the element pointed by first but not the element pointed by last.


Syntax:-
void reverse(BidirectionalIterator first, BidirectionalIterator last)
BidirectionalIterator is an iterator that can be used to access any
elements of a container in both forward and backward direction.


Examples:-
Input : 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
Output :10 11 12 13 14 17 16 15
Explanation:
reverse(v.begin() + 5, v.begin() + 8);
In the above function, input we have applied reverse() on the vector
from index 5 to index 7.
Therefore when we display the vector we get reverse order
from index 5 to index 7.
